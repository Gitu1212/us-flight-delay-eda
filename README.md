## 📊 Data Analysis Framework

This project uses a six-step framework for data analysis:

1. **Define the Question**: What factors contribute to flight delays?
2. **Collect Data**: Utilize the 2015 US flight delay dataset from Kaggle.
3. **Clean Data**: Handle missing values, outliers, and data types.
4. **Explore Data**: Use visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships.
5. **Model Data**: Apply statistical methods to analyze the findings.
6. **Communicate Results**: Present insights in a clear and concise manner.

## 📚 Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## 📈 Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding the data. Here are some examples of the types of plots included in the analysis:

- **Bar Charts**: To compare flight delays by airline.
- **Heatmaps**: To show the correlation between different variables.
- **Time Series Plots**: To visualize delays over time.

## 📊 Example Analysis

### Delay by Airline

One of the first analyses conducted is to examine flight delays by airline. This can help identify which airlines are most affected by delays. The analysis reveals trends that may be influenced by factors such as weather, operational issues, or airport congestion.

### Seasonal Trends

Another important aspect is understanding how delays vary by season. By plotting delays over the months, we can identify peak times for delays, helping airlines and passengers plan better.

## 📖 Documentation

The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations for each step of the analysis. Users can follow along and replicate the analysis on their own datasets.
