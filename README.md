# us-flight-delay-eda-2015
==========================
---
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using 2015 US flight delay data. This notebook follows a clean, modular 6-step pipeline for working with real-world datasets — from loading to visualization.
---

==============
## Objectives:
==============
1. Develop an EDA pipeline that is clean, simple and can be reused for different Datasets.
2. Log each change made and why for better understanding.
3. visualise trends accross airports airlines and flights dataframes, using seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot.
4. Get better at asking the right questions when data quality or meaning isn’t obvious.

=======================
## Dataset Information:
=======================
Project uses information from the dataset below:
[Kaggle Flight Delay Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/flight-delays-data-usa)**:

consists of 3 csv files:
1. `airports.csv` — metadata on US airports
2. `airlines.csv` — metadata on airline codes
3. `flights.csv` — flight-level data including delays, departure/arrival times, airtime
